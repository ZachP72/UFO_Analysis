# UFO_Analysis
This webpage is made using Javascript and bootstrap in order to make a UFO sightings page which is easy to follow. 

## Overview
The focus of this project was to create an HTML page that relays the information of a Javascript data file to the page. Because we want to filter out data to see specific types of UFO sightings, we thought it was best to create an easy way to do that by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The search is extremely easy to perform. As described above, there are  5 filters which include date, city, state, country, and shape. All you have to do is type in what you are looking for. You can also use the search feature to add multiple filters in one search.

## Summary
One of the biggest drawback is the lack of evidence and truth behind these sightings. For all we know these could just be a bunch of bs sightings. So one additional development we could add is a "verified" column which allows the users to check which sightings have been checked and verified by multiple people seeing the same thing. Another setting you could add to this webpage is a "time since last sighting" table between states, countries, and cities. This would help inform the user of the amount of UFO visits there have been to 1 location of the span of x time.
